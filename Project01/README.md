## Project Overview

Project 01 performs statistical analysis and visualization using Python. The code includes data processing, hypothesis testing, and plotting to analyze various datasets.

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have the following packages installed:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import scipy.stats as stats
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import statsmodels
import scipy
import time
```

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scipy matplotlib statsmodels
```

## Running the Code

Open Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open the notebook file (`project01.ipynb`) and execute the cells in order.

Ensure that you replace the dataset paths in the code with the correct paths on your computer before running.

## Output

- The program will generate statistical summaries and visualizations.
- Code results will be displayed in the notebook file (`project01.ipynb`).
- A separate document (`project01_answer.pdf`) will include written responses to the project assignment.
