# FinTech 545 Final Project

## Overview

This project analyzes the performance and risk characteristics of three equity portfolios acquired at the end of 2023. It applies a range of financial modeling techniques including CAPM-based attribution, Sharpe ratio optimization, Expected Shortfall-based risk parity, and distribution fitting using non-Gaussian models. The analysis culminates in simulation-based risk estimation using both Gaussian copulas and multivariate normal models.

The final paper summarizing the methodology, reasoning, and results is provided in `final project paper.pdf`.

## Files

- `final_project.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing all code and analysis.
- `final project paper.pdf`: The final project paper describing the methodology, reasoning, and results.

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure the following Python packages are installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scipy statsmodels
```
## Running the Code

Open Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open the notebook file (`final_project.ipynbb`) and execute the cells in order.

## Output

- The notebook (`final_project.ipynb`) contains all code, visualizations, and statistical modeling steps.
- Key results such as portfolio performance attribution, VaR/ES estimates, and optimized weights are shown directly in the notebook output cells.
- A final written report summarizing methods, reasoning, and results is compiled in `final project paper.pdf`.
